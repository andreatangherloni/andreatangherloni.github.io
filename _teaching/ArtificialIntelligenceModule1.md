I have been teaching this course since 2025. 

Biomedical data are increasingly large, complex, and information-rich. As a result, the use of AI for their analysis and interpretation is becoming essential. This course offers a foundational introduction to AI, forming part of a broader toolkit alongside the Machine Learning and AI Module 2 courses. It begins with a focus on unsupervised learning, emphasising methods for handling high-dimensional and structurally complex data. The course then introduces reinforcement learning, a rapidly growing area in biomedical applications. Theoretical concepts will be reinforced through hands-on practical sessions using real-world datasets and the Python programming language for statistical analysis.
