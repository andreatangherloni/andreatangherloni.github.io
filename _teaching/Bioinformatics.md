I have been teaching this course since 2025. 

Bioinformatics, the application of computer science to biology, has revolutionised our understanding of life and its complexities. It has enabled us to study biology, such as exploring the human genome, and also to build useful models that empower medics to deliver better treatments. Without powerful computer methods, interpreting data such as DNA sequencing, or tracking the spread or the evolution of disease would be impossible. Computers play a pivotal role in drug development, agricultural advancements, and environmental conservation efforts. Simultaneously, biology has inspired groundbreaking innovations in computer science, from modelling neurons to leveraging evolution for optimisation algorithms. This course aims to provide students with a solid understanding of the core principles and applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the life and health sciences. While AI has been applied to medicine for over 50 years, the current era presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities due to the sheer quantity, complexity, and resolution of biological data. Students will gain extensive knowledge of how current AI methods address fundamental questions in biology and medicine. Additionally, the course will explore how biological systems, including evolutionary principles, inspire the development of innovative AI algorithms. By mastering these tools and techniques, students will be equipped to contribute to transformative advancements in science and medicine.
