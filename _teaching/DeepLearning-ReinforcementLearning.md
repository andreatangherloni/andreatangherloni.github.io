In this course, we will investigate the algorithmic principles and foundations of two particularly exciting subfields of Machine Learning: deep learning and reinforcement learning. The first part of the course focuses on deep learning, where we develop the conceptual tools to understand what happens when a neural net is trained and the latest architectural advancements that have proven remarkably effective in practical applications. The second part of the course focuses on sequential decision-making, in which an agent interacts with an unknown environment to achieve a goal. We will start from the multi-armed bandits setting and gradually increase the complexity of the scenarios, culminating in general reinforcement learning problems.
