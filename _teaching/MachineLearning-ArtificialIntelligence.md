I taught this course in 2024 and 2025. 

The mission of the course is to introduce the students to state-of-the-art approaches of modern artificial intelligence. The course will focus on deep learning architectures at the frontier of current research and applications, with a particular emphasis on the basic aspects and building blocks that constitute the bedrock of deep learning techniques.
