Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the design and development of novel computational methods to tackle complex problems in biology and medicine. To do so, I combine Computational Intelligence techniques (such as Evolutionary Computation, Swarm Intelligence, and Fuzzy Logic) with Deep Learning to develop effective and efficient solutions for a wide range of applications, including:
- Computational Biology and Systems Biology
- Bioinformatics and Genome Analysis
- Biomedical Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition
- Single-cell Omics and Data Integration

Academic Background
======
I earned both my BSc and MSc in Computer Science from the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy) in 2013 and 2015, respectively. My Master’s thesis focused on simulating large-scale biochemical models, where I proposed a GPU-accelerated simulation approach.

In 2019, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the same university, with a thesis titled "High-Performance Computing to tackle complex problems in life sciences",supervised by Prof. Daniela Besozzi and Prof. Paolo Cazzaniga. During my doctoral studies, I spent research periods abroad at:
- The Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University (Nashville, TN, USA)
- The Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge (Cambridge, UK)

My PhD research explored the use of GPGPU Computing, High-Performance Computing, and AI techniques to address various biomedical problems, including:
- Parameter estimation in Systems Biology
- Haplotype assembly in genome analysis
- Enhancement and segmentation of bimodal MRI images


Professional Experience
======
From November 2018 to November 2020, I was a Research Associate at the Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, and the Wellcome Trust–MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute. I was also a visiting researcher at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. During this time, I focused on developing novel computational approaches for analysing single-cell sequencing data, particularly scRNA-Seq.

From December 2020 to November 2022, I served as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Human and Social Sciences, University of Bergamo. I then moved to the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics (BIDSA) and the Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University, where I served as a Postdoctoral Fellow until August 2023. My work in these roles centred on designing AI-based tools to enhance understanding of cellular development and disease progression.

Since September 2023, I have been an Assistant Professor in the newly established Department of Computing Sciences at Bocconi University. My research continues to explore how AI and computational methods can support translational biomedical research and precision medicine. I collaborate closely with biologists and clinicians to perform data integration, propose new AI-driven strategies, and develop computational tools tailored to the needs of modern medicine.
